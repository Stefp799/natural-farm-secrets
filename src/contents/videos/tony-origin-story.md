For three generations, the Busatta family vineyard in Tuscany had been the pride of their small village. But by 2018, something was desperately wrong.

The soil that had once produced award-winning grapes was depleted, lifeless. Chemical fertilizers had stopped working. The vines looked tired, and harvests were declining year after year.

**"I was losing hope,"** Tony recalls, standing among the rows that nearly broke his family's 150-year farming legacy. **"My grandfather would have been heartbroken."**

## The Memory That Changed Everything

Then, during a particularly difficult harvest in 2019, Tony remembered something his grandfather used to say: *"The little workers know secrets we have forgotten."*

His grandfather had been talking about earthworms.
